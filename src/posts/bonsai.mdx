"Look, at those bonsai trees at that stall,

Compared to a common tree, it is very small, 

And is so much expensive compared to that common tree, 

Oh a tree this small should be given for free 

They require too much work and care 

And the results are not much, to be fair"

These words by said by man

Who picks out faults in everything he seee

And misses out the points

That make them unique
